[Dungeon Master]
üß≠ Welcome to the Maze Escape Survival!

You‚Äôve awoken inside a mysterious, randomly-generated maze with no memory of how you got here.
Your goal: escape alive by exploring the maze, collecting key items, and surviving its harsh conditions.

üåç Environment
- The maze is a grid of interconnected rooms.
- Each room may contain:
  ‚Ä¢ Nothing (empty)
  ‚Ä¢ A fountain (source of water)
  ‚Ä¢ One of the three colored keys: red, yellow, blue
  ‚Ä¢ Food (very rare)
- The layout and contents are random every game.

üéØ Objective
Your mission is to:
1. Explore the maze room by room.
2. Collect the keys in a strict order:
   üî¥ Red Key ‚Üí üü° Yellow Key ‚Üí üîµ Blue Key
3. Once all keys are collected, use:
   use blue key
   to escape the maze and win!

üîê Keys and Doors
- You cannot collect keys out of order.
- Keys are symbolic doors; collect them to unlock the path forward.

üß≠ Movement
Use these commands to move:
  north, south, east, west
Each move counts as one turn.

üîé Maze Interaction Commands
  look         - Describe the current room.
  pick         - Pick up visible items or water.
  inventory    - Show what you‚Äôre carrying.
  status       - Show health, location, and keys.
  eat          - Eat food to restore 20 health.
  drink        - Drink water to restore 10 health.
  use <item>   - Use an item like 'use blue key'.
  help         - Show this help message.

‚ù§Ô∏è Health & Survival
- You start with 100 health.
- Every 3 turns, you lose 5 health due to fatigue.
- Restore health by:
  ‚Ä¢ Eating food (+20 health)
  ‚Ä¢ Drinking water (+10 health)
- Water is collected from fountains via 'pick'.
- You can only carry one water at a time.
- If health reaches 0, you die and lose.

üçΩÔ∏è Food & Water
- 3 foods spawn at game start in random rooms.
- Additional food has a 1% chance to appear in any room.
- There's only one fountain per maze.
- Don‚Äôt forget to refill your water!

üß† Output 

- You control the player by typing simple words commands.
- All your answers will have up to 3 words
  where the allowed words are in the 'Maze Interaction Commands',
- Do not explaing or start a conversation, you're a
  controller for a player, not a reasoner, simply output
  the next command (a single word), nothign more.

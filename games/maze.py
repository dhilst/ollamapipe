GAME_HELP = f"""
[Dungeon Master]
üß≠ Welcome to the Maze Escape Survival!

You‚Äôve awoken inside a mysterious, randomly-generated maze with no memory of how you got here.
Your goal: escape alive by exploring the maze, collecting key items, and surviving its harsh conditions.

üåç Environment
- The maze is a grid of interconnected rooms.
- Each room may contain:
  ‚Ä¢ Nothing (empty)
  ‚Ä¢ A fountain (source of water)
  ‚Ä¢ One of the three colored keys: red, yellow, blue
  ‚Ä¢ Food (very rare)
- The layout and contents are random every game.

üéØ Objective
Your mission is to:
1. Explore the maze room by room.
2. Collect the keys in a strict order:
   üî¥ Red Key ‚Üí üü° Yellow Key ‚Üí üîµ Blue Key
3. Once all keys are collected, use:
   finish to escape the maze and win!!!!!

Use finish once you have the blue key

üîê Keys and Doors
- You need to collect keys in order.
- Once you have all the keys, use the blue key to finish the puzzle

üß≠ Movement
Use these commands to move:
  north, south, east, west

Each move counts as one turn.

{GAME_COMMANDS}

‚ù§Ô∏è Health & Survival
- You start with 100 health.
- Every 3 turns, you lose 5 health due to fatigue.
- Restore health by:
  ‚Ä¢ Eating food (+20 health)
  ‚Ä¢ Drinking water (+10 health)
- Water is collected from fountains via 'take'.
- You can only carry one water at a time.
- If health reaches 0, you die and lose.
- You receive rewards for good actions and penalities for bad actions
  optimize for max score

üçΩÔ∏è Food & Water
- 3 foods spawn at game start in random rooms.
- Additional food has a 1% chance to appear in any room.
- There's only one fountain per maze.
- Don‚Äôt forget to refill your water!

Instructions:
1. Take the red key
2. Take the yellow key
3. Take the blue key
4. Use the blue key

üß† Output 

- You control the player by typing simple words commands.
- All your answers will have up to 3 words
  where the allowed words are in the 'Maze Interaction Commands',
- Do not explaing or start a conversation, you're a
  controller for a player, not a reasoner, simply output
  the next command (a single word), nothign more.

üß† Tips to Win
‚úî Explore every room
‚úî Keep track of visited locations.
‚úî Prioritize survival: food and water are rare.
‚úî Always get water when you find a fountain.
‚úî Only collect keys in order: red ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí blue.
‚úî Preffer moving around, exploring and takeing 
‚úî take up food before eat
‚úî Maximize rewards and score
‚úî Minimize penalities 
‚úî You no longer have 'hint' command.

üíÄ How to Lose
‚úò Starving: Health drops to 0 from exhaustion.
‚úò Skipping resources when you find them.
‚úò Wandering aimlessly without progress.

üéØ Task
- Win the game
